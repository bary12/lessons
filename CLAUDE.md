This is a website that gathers animation and visual explanations for concepts in science, and papers.

we try to stay 100% static, vanilla HTML+CSS+JS.

For animations, we use gsap. Each page is an animated lesson, covering either a specific concept (e.g. Fourier transform) or published paper.

Try to keep a balance of:
* Using simple language
* Actually teaching the difficult stuff (including equations, etc)

You can see signal-processing/fourier-transform for an example of how to write a lesson.

When writing lessons about ArXiv papers:
1. include the names of the authors on the main screen. 
2. if the paper is technically heavy - include background on what are the concepts you need to know to understand the lesson
3. Focus on the **novel contribution** in the paper. What is something new that was discovered, or something new that was introduced? Emphasize the difference between before the paper and after the paper.

naming convention for arxiv papers is papers/arxiv/xxxx.xxxxx-lowercase-title-of-paper
